## 🚀 How to Use This Data

### 1. Run Database Setup
```bash
# In Supabase SQL Editor
# Paste and run: /COMPLETE_SETUP_WITH_GRAPH.sql
```

### 2. Application Defaults to October 2025
The app automatically opens to October 2025:
- **MonthContext** defaults to `2025-10-01`
- **Graph Version** is effective from `2025-10-01`
- **All timesheets** are for October 2025 weeks

### 3. Navigate the Data
- **Timesheets Tab** → See Week 1 (Oct 6-12) and Week 2 (Oct 13-19)
- **WorkGraph Tab** → See the organizational structure for October 2025
- **Calendar View** → Browse daily entries for October

### 4. Test Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Approval Workflow**
- Sarah Johnson has 2 pending timesheets (Week 1 & Week 2)
- Mike Chen has 2 pending timesheets
- Test approval flows and status changes

**Scenario 2: Multi-Week Analysis**
- Sarah: 40 hours both weeks (consistent)
- Mike: 38 hours Week 1, 40 hours Week 2 (ramping up)
- Emily: 35 hours Week 1, 38 hours Week 2

**Scenario 3: Mixed Contract Types**
- Hourly: Sarah, Mike, Emily, Robert, Lisa, Alex
- Daily: Sophia, Oliver
- Test rate calculations for both types

**Scenario 4: Graph Versioning**
- Create new nodes/edges in WorkGraph
- Click "Save Graph" → Creates version 2
- Change month → Version switches based on effective dates

## ✅ Verification Queries

After running setup, verify with these SQL queries:

```sql
-- Check all data was inserted
SELECT 
  'organizations' as table_name, 
  COUNT(*)::text as records
FROM organizations
UNION ALL
SELECT 'project_contracts', COUNT(*)::text FROM project_contracts
UNION ALL
SELECT 'timesheet_periods', COUNT(*)::text FROM timesheet_periods
UNION ALL
SELECT 'timesheet_entries', COUNT(*)::text FROM timesheet_entries
UNION ALL
SELECT 'graph_versions', COUNT(*)::text FROM graph_versions
ORDER BY table_name;

-- Expected Results:
-- organizations: 5
-- project_contracts: 8
-- timesheet_periods: 12 (8 for Week 1, 4 for Week 2)
-- timesheet_entries: 40+
-- graph_versions: 1

-- View October 2025 timesheets
SELECT 
  p.id,
  c.user_name,
  p.week_start_date,
  p.week_end_date,
  p.total_hours,
  p.total_days,
  p.status
FROM timesheet_periods p
JOIN project_contracts c ON p.contract_id = c.id
WHERE p.week_start_date >= '2025-10-01'
  AND p.week_start_date < '2025-11-01'
ORDER BY p.week_start_date, c.user_name;

-- View current graph version
SELECT 
  project_id,
  version_number,
  effective_from_date,
  effective_to_date,
  change_summary,
  jsonb_array_length(graph_data->'nodes') as node_count,
  jsonb_array_length(graph_data->'edges') as edge_count
FROM graph_versions
WHERE effective_to_date IS NULL;
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. ✅ Run `/COMPLETE_SETUP_WITH_GRAPH.sql` in Supabase
2. ✅ Verify all tables have data (see queries above)
3. ✅ Open WorkGraph app → Should default to October 2025
4. ✅ Test timesheet approval flows
5. ✅ Test WorkGraph builder with versioning
6. ✅ Create new graph versions for November 2025
