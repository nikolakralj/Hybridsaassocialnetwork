## 📋 5-Minute Checklist

### ✅ Step 1: Open SQL File (30 seconds)
```
1. Open this project in your editor
2. Find file: /COMPLETE_SETUP_WITH_GRAPH.sql
3. Select ALL content (Ctrl+A)
4. Copy (Ctrl+C)
```

### ✅ Step 2: Run in Supabase (2 minutes)
```
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Click: Your project name
3. Click: "SQL Editor" (left sidebar)
4. Click: "New Query" button (top right)
5. Paste: Your copied SQL (Ctrl+V)
6. Click: "RUN" button (bottom right)
7. Wait: ~10 seconds for completion
```

### ✅ Step 3: Verify Success (1 minute)
```
Look for this output at the bottom:

✅ Organizations: 5
✅ Project Contracts: 8
✅ Timesheet Periods: 12
✅ Timesheet Entries: 40+
✅ Graph Versions: 1

If you see these numbers → SUCCESS!
```

### ✅ Step 4: Refresh App (30 seconds)
```
1. Go to your WorkGraph app
2. Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
3. Done!
```

### ✅ Step 5: Verify It Works (1 minute)
```
Look for these 3 things:

1. Toolbar (top right):
   📅 October 2025 [BLUE BADGE] ← Should see this!

2. Click Emily Davis node:
   Total Hours: 73 hrs ← NOT 0!
   This Month: 35-73 hrs ← NOT 0!

3. Click Timesheets tab:
   Week 1: Oct 6-12, 2025 ← Should see this!
   Week 2: Oct 13-19, 2025 ← Should see this!

If all 3 are true → YOU'RE DONE! 🎉

## ❌ What NOT to Do

```
❌ Don't modify any code files - already fixed
❌ Don't create new tables manually - script does it
❌ Don't run multiple times - once is enough
❌ Don't skip the refresh - necessary to see changes
```

---

## ✅ What's Already Fixed (No Action Needed)

```
✅ Stats hook date logic - uses October 2025
✅ Week matching logic - sums all weeks correctly
✅ Month indicator - shows in toolbar
✅ SQL script - JSON formatting fixed
✅ All TypeScript types - no compilation errors
✅ All imports - properly resolved
✅ Database schema - correct structure
```

## 🆘 Quick Troubleshooting

### "Still shows 0 hours"
```
→ Did you refresh? Ctrl+Shift+R
→ Check browser console for errors (F12)
→ Clear cache: Settings → Privacy → Clear cache
```

### "SQL script failed"
```
→ Check you have admin access in Supabase
→ Copy script again (might have corruption)
→ Check error message in Query Results
```

### "Can't find October 2025 badge"
```
→ Look in WorkGraph tab (not Timesheets)
→ Look top-right toolbar, next to "Validate"
→ Should be blue badge with calendar icon
```
